a the material for a &quot;Train the Trainers&quot; event. \nThe trainers are preparing to deliver the NeCTAR cloud lessons.\nThus they must be familiar with the basics of the NeCTAR cloud.

Yet most researchers are\nnot taught to do this!\nA course to tackle this problem was developed and run by Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda in 1998.\nFrom the delivery of this course they learnt that:\n-- Slide --\nLesson 1\n\nWeek long courses frazzle the attendees brains\nTextbook SLDC1 is not useful to researchers\n\n1: Software Development Life Cycle\n-- Slide End --\nDiscussion  Try to have a discussion about the SLDC, and why this might be.\nSubsequent to this the course materials were put on line.

Then the group will work through\nthe lesson plan and associated lesson. We&#39;ll take, say, 45 minutes to do this.\nThen we will meet up again and try presenting our material for a short period.\nAs we work through this, I want you all to note any errors or changes that need to be done to the course material.\nBy raising issues!\n-- Slide --\nDo you know how to raise an issue on GitHub?\n\nG = Yes.\nR = No.\n\n-- Slide End --\nIf there are any No&#39;s: well, they need to be shown!\n-- Slide --\nTrue or False: Memory records exactly what we experience...\n\nG = True.\nR = False.\n\n-- Slide End --\nA False - Sadly it&#39;s been proved that not only is our memory of what we experience highly unreliable, it&#39;s even\npossible to plant false remembered experiences through clever questions.\n-- Slide --\nBTW - who has seen this:\n\n\n-- Slide End --\nOnce you&#39;ve worked through your chosen lesson and think you are ready to present hold up a Green sticky note!\nRemember, the easy thing about software carpentry is that you can present with the lesson right up\nin front of you. So you don&#39;t have to memorize anything.\nI&#39;ve seen people go as far as reading from the lesson.\nI try not to: I try to keep the notes to one side, and to glance at them from time to time. I do scribble highlights\nof important stuff on them so I don&#39;t miss it.\nThe more familiar I am with material the less I need to look at the material.\nBut I plead guilty to putting extra slides up just to keep me on track...\nTake break while people go through the lessons\nImproving our teaching\nBefore we actually try presenting lets talk about improving our teaching.\nWe all have unconscious nervous habits. I used to rock backward and forwards.\nWhen that was pointed out to me I stopped doing it. Then I started wringing my hands instead.\nThat was pointed out to. I stopped doing it. Then I started to rock from side to side.\nThat was pointed out to me...\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say here is that I need constant input on what I&#39;m doing, and how I can improve on it.\nWhen I was first told about my rocking from side to side, I was horrified. I took it personally.\n&quot;What did people think of me? I must have looked odd!&quot;\nBut the more feedback I&#39;ve got, the more I&#39;ve learnt to not take it personally: to rather find it interesting.\nIn a scientific way. I&#39;ve found that rather than wondering what people think of me, by trying to understand\nwhy I&#39;m doing these oddities, the easier it is to tackle them.\nThe reason I&#39;m giving you this viewpoint is that you should solicit feedback about your teaching if you want to\nimprove. And that it&#39;s just once person&#39;s point of view. Try not to take it personally. Understand it. If it has\nmerit try to fix it. If it doesn&#39;t, note it. It&#39;s just how you improve!\nAnd remember, just have we have points for improvement, we also have things we do really well.\nSo I ask for feedback in order to improve: but I always ask for one point of improvement, and for one thing\nthat I&#39;ve done really well. That way I keep my equilibrium.\nNever teach alone if you can help it! And solicit feedback from your fellow teachers!\nSo now we are going to take turns in teaching a short extract from each of our chosen lessons.\nWork out a suitable time for each person to teach for\nAt the end of each timed session we the learners will give the teacher a heads up on one thing we thought they\ncan improve on, and the one thing that they do really well. Just for practice.\nIf there are a large number of teachers, do a random sampling\nFinally, before we launch into this practice:\n-- Slide --\nNerves!\n-- Slide End --\nI get stage fright: how do I handle it?\nThere&#39;s a very simple technique.\n-- Slide --\n&quot;You’re Excited, Not Nervous.

They also allow\nus to break up the proceedings with some humour.\nThe multi choice question answer cards are a real pain to manage and distribute.
