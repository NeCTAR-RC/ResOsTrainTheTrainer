<h2 id="personas-an-introduction">Personas: an introduction</h2>
<p>Ok, break up into groups of 3-4 people.</p>
<p>The first exercise that I want you to do as a group is to develop a persona.</p>
<p>&quot;What&apos;s a persona?&quot; I think I hear you ask.</p>
<p>A persona is the representation of the goals and behaviour of a group of hypothetical users.</p>
<p>The theory is that by understanding the needs and abilities of that persona, you can better satisfy the needs and
abilities of the larger group.</p>
<p>A good persona should represent a skill set and a behaviour pattern - not a job description.</p>
<p>Software Carpentry make use of persona&apos;s: they call them &quot;Learner Profiles&quot;.</p>
<p>By example, here&apos;s a persona that we developed:</p>
<p>-- <em>Slide</em> --
<strong>Name:</strong>  Associate Professor Glenn Bording</p>
<p><strong>Job title:</strong>  Senior researcher and lecturer, Radio Astronomy group</p>
<p><strong>Demographics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>40 years old</li>
<li>Programming experience in C and Fortran</li>
<li>Basic HPC experience</li>
<li>Prefers to work with physical hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>-- <em>Slide End</em> --</p>
<p>-- <em>Slide</em> --</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While preparing a new course for undergraduates, developed a computing challenge to support research using real data</li>
<li>Realised the BYOD for most students were not powerful enough</li>
<li>Labs not suitable for task</li>
<li>Teaching parallel programming and getting accounts for students would be difficult</li>
<li>Heard about the research cloud</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now keen to learn about ResOS to see if it solves this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>-- <em>Slide End</em> --</p>
<p>Once you, as a group, have agreed on your persona, hold up a green sticky note. But you&apos;d better be quick, because
I&apos;m giving you only 5 minutes!</p>
<p>For more on personas, there is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28user_experience%29" _target="blank">wikipedia entry</a> and of
course, the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum/dp/0672326140" _target="blank">The Inmates are Running the Asylum</a>.
Also, the blog posting <a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2001/08/perfecting_your_personas" _target="blank">Perfecting Your Persona&apos;s</a>
And dont&apos; forget: <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/audience/" _target="blank">Software Carpentry&apos;s Personas</a>.</p>
<p>Ok: for our purposes today, the persona&apos;s that you have developed represent the people that you will be delivering
our ResOS training course to.</p>
<p>So as we go through the rest of today I want each group to ask themselves just what it would take to communicate
the concepts or activities we are covering to this persona.</p>
<p>If you find you can&apos;t do it, then make a note, and we will all discuss it after the next section
and see if we can come up with a better approach.</p>
<p><strong>Ask for one or two persona&apos;s to be read out</strong></p>
<p>So as you have seen, we have developed a fairly formal course intended to be delivered by a person standing
in front of a class.</p>
<p>And we&apos;ve now done a fairly high level walk through of the lesson plans and their formatting: and of the
tool we&apos;ve developed to support our delivery.</p>
<p>We are now going to split up into groups: each group will choose a lesson to cover. Then the group will work through
the lesson plan and associated lesson. We&apos;ll take, say, 45 minutes to do this.</p>
<p>Then we will meet up again and try presenting our material for a short period.</p>
<p>As we work through this, I want you all to note any errors or changes that need to be done to the course material.</p>
<p>By raising issues!</p>
<p>-- <em>Slide</em> --</p>
<h3 id="do-you-know-how-to-raise-an-issue-on-github">Do you know how to raise an issue on GitHub?</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = Yes.</li>
<li><span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = No.</li>
</ul>
<p>-- <em>Slide End</em> --</p>
<p>If there are any No&apos;s: well, they need to be shown!</p>
<p>-- <em>Slide</em> --</p>
<h3 id="true-or-false-memory-records-exactly-what-we-experience">True or False: Memory records exactly what we experience...</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:white;background:green">G</span> = True.</li>
<li><span style="color:white;background:red">R</span> = False.</li>
</ul>
<p>-- <em>Slide End</em> --</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> False - Sadly it&apos;s been proved that not only is our memory of what we experience highly unreliable, it&apos;s even
possible to plant false remembered experiences through clever questions.</p>

<p>-- <em>Slide End</em> --</p>
<p>Once you&apos;ve worked through your chosen lesson and think you are ready to present hold up a Green sticky note!</p>
<p>Remember, the easy thing about software carpentry is that you can present with the lesson right up
in front of you. So you don&apos;t have to memorize anything.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve seen people go as far as reading from the lesson.</p>
<p>I try not to: I try to keep the notes to one side, and to glance at them from time to time. I do scribble highlights
of important stuff on them so I don&apos;t miss it.</p>
<p>The more familiar I am with material the less I need to look at the material.</p>
<p>But I plead guilty to putting extra slides up just to keep me on track...</p>
<pre><code>Take break while people go through the lessons
</code></pre><h1 id="improving-our-teaching">Improving our teaching</h1>
<p>Before we actually try presenting lets talk about improving our teaching.</p>
<p>We all have unconscious nervous habits. I used to rock backward and forwards.</p>
<p>When that was pointed out to me I stopped doing it. Then I started wringing my hands instead.</p>
<p>That was pointed out to. I stopped doing it. Then I started to rock from side to side.</p>
<p>That was pointed out to me...</p>
<p>What I&apos;m trying to say here is that I need constant input on what I&apos;m doing, and how I can improve on it.</p>
<p>When I was first told about my rocking from side to side, I was horrified. I took it personally.</p>
<p>&quot;What did people think of me? I must have looked odd!&quot;</p>
<p>But the more feedback I&apos;ve got, the more I&apos;ve learnt to not take it personally: to rather find it interesting.</p>
<p>In a scientific way. I&apos;ve found that rather than wondering what people think of me, by trying to understand
why I&apos;m doing these oddities, the easier it is to tackle them.</p>
<p>The reason I&apos;m giving you this viewpoint is that you should solicit feedback about your teaching if you want to
improve. And that it&apos;s just once person&apos;s point of view. Try not to take it personally. Understand it. If it has
merit try to fix it. If it doesn&apos;t, note it. It&apos;s just how you improve!</p>
<p>And remember, just have we have points for improvement, we also have things we do really well.</p>
<p>So I ask for feedback in order to improve: but I always ask for one point of improvement, and for one thing
that I&apos;ve done really well. That way I keep my equilibrium.</p>
<p>Never teach alone if you can help it! And solicit feedback from your fellow teachers!</p>
<p>So now we are going to take turns in teaching a short extract from each of our chosen lessons.</p>
<pre><code>Work out a suitable time for each person to teach for
</code></pre><p>At the end of each timed session we the learners will give the teacher a heads up on one thing we thought they
can improve on, and the one thing that they do really well. Just for practice.</p>
<pre><code>If there are a large number of teachers, do a random sampling
</code></pre><p>Finally, before we launch into this practice:</p>
<p>-- <em>Slide</em> --</p>
<h3 id="nerves">Nerves!</h3>
<p>-- <em>Slide End</em> --</p>
<p>I get stage fright: how do I handle it?</p>
<p>There&apos;s a very simple technique.</p>
<p>-- <em>Slide</em> --</p>
<p><a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/03/youre-excited-not-nervous-you-just-keep-telling-yourself-that.html" _target="blank">&quot;<em>You&#x2019;re Excited, Not Nervous. You Just Keep Telling Yourself That.</em>&quot;</a></p>
<p>-- <em>Slide End</em> --</p>
<p>You look forward to the event: its an opportunity. Don&apos;t fear it!</p>
<p>Ok: let&apos;s present!</p>
<pre><code>Now present and do the feedback...
