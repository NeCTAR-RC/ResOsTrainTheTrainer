# Sample sticky note feedback

From a 12 person class (20 people enrolled), mixing up both HPC and the cloud.

There were two sessions, a 2 hour one before lunch, and a 2 hour one after lunch.

Covered from the cloud training was:

* Lesson 1: Overview via the dashboard
* Lesson 2: Getting an instance up and running
* Lesson 3: SSH'ing into your instance
* Lesson 8: The Object store

## Lesson 1

The task given was:

"*Write one thing you've learnt on the green sticky note, and one thing you found confusing on
the red sticky note.*"

| Red | Comment |
| --- | ------- |
| Maybe initialize an instance to demystify the process | My mistake. I ordinarily do, but due to time pressure, skipped this :( |
| Show how to launch an instance! | " |
| Would love to see what an instance looks like before ending | " |
| Some of the terminology needs more explanation | Hmm. How?  |
| Would love to benefit from a clearer understanding of who is presenting | My bad. I didn't do great introductions |
| More time would be good | A problem for us: This depends so much on the individual. |
| More discussion on the benefits of using NeCTAR | Good point. |
| Provide challenges or exercises for the audience | They come from lesson 2 onwards. This is a problem for us, in a way |
| More technical things, please | " |
| I would like to learn more about cloud orchestration | A bit much to chew off in 1 day |

1: Some notes had multiple points on them.

## The day as a whole

After lunch only 7 people returned. Another drifted in an hour later.

For this event it turned out that there was [some confusion about
about the actual course dates and times](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/introduction-to-hpc-and-cloud-computing-tickets-24045681280)
by attendees :(

Of those 7, 3 had to leave early, meaning only 4 were there at the end.

Of those 4 only three left feedback.

The question asked was:

"*Write one thing you've liked about the course on the green sticky note,
and one thing we can do to improve the course on the red sticky note.*"

| Green |
| ----- |
| I really liked the examples and the topic |
| I want an advanced course on NeCTAR now! |
| Really good overview of systems and processes |

| Red | Comment |
| ----| ------- |
| Please could we have an up front explanation of the differences between HPC and cloud? | Yes: good point! |
| I really would like to have a two day session: so we can cover more, and get more practice! | A positive? |

# Instructors thoughts

The mix of hpc and cloud didn't work to well. We will try to improve it, in this lesson
set, but in future we should possibly split it into different streams. The downside of this
is that Spartan users need to understand the underlying cloud architecture, so they need the
cloud knowledge.

The Etherpad didn't work very well. Despite having the pre-prepared links, only 5 people
out of the 12 bothered to open it and look at it.

There were a mix of skills in the cloud camp. Some were left behind, given the feedback.
But this wasn't apparent to the instructors.

The advanced users coped quite well with the material, and didn't seemed bored.

We did no preparation other than you need to bring a laptop: and everyone was able to log
in to the cloud: and install and use putty. It did chew up some time, though, which was
problematic. It was also good having a project to add users with expired personal tenancies
two: of the twelve, two needed adding for this reason.

We should take the keypair detail out of Lesson 1 and put it into Lesson 2. This
would speed Lesson 1 up and get fingers typing faster...

We also need to look at the wording of the event invite, and see why people were confused about the times.
And further, perhaps actually send out a reminder email listing the topics to be covered on the day.

We have hand waved over the fact that new user logging into the dashboard for the first time will be asked to
choose an institution, and also that they will be shown the terms dialogue.
